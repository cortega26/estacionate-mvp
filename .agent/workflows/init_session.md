description: Initialize a new session by reading mandatory context.
---

This workflow ensures you have the necessary context to work on the "Estacionate" MVP.

1. **Read Technical Specification**
   Read `documentation/TECH_SPEC.md` to understand the database schema, API structure, and business rules.

2. **Read Operational Protocol**
   Read `documentation/PROTOCOL.md` to understand the terminal limits, diff formats, and behavior rules.

3. **Read Lessons Learned**
   Read `documentation/LESSONS.md` to review past mistakes and avoiding repeating them.

4. **Self-Correction**
   If you find any discrepancies between `TECH_SPEC.md` and the codebase during your session, assume the code is the source of truth but flag it for the user.
